		<h2 id="education">Education</h2>
		<p>Born 1996 in a small town (or village) in Sweden called Smedjebacken. 
		Moved to Norrköping in 2015 to study Master of Science in Media Technology and Engineering at <b>Linköping University (LiU)</b>. 
		Applied and got accepted for 5 months of exchange studies at <b>Tokyo Institute of Technology</b>, spring semester of 2019. 
		Came back to Linköping University in September of 2019 to start the final year of the master program. 
		Moved to Enschede, Netherlands in March 2020 as part of placement studies and final Master Thesis at <b>University of Twente.</b></p>

		<p><strong>Master's Thesis:</strong> <i>Conversational Chatbots With Memory-based Question and Answer Generation</i> - <a href="http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:liu:diva-171927">URL<em></em></a>.</p>
		<p><strong>Current activity:</strong> Working on personal projects & looking for a game development/programmer job.</p>
		
		<h2 id="goals">Goals and Aspirations</h2>
		<p>I currently aspire to grow as a programmer and as a developer. 
		I am looking forward to starting a career in the game industry as a game programmer.
		</p><p>
		Then, after working for a couple of years and learning as much as I can, 
		I aim to either start or join a small studio with a focus on developing party type games,
		and games that you have fun playing with/against your friends.
		</p><p>
		I also see myself taking courses in the (somewhat near) future related to robotics, 
		and picking up the hobby of building stuff and programming robots
		as that seems pretty cool! 
		I mean, what's the point of being an engineer in this field if you cannot build things with an embedded system!</p>
		<p>
		Finally, I would love to move back to Japan if the opportunity presents itself, since living in Tokyo was a lot of fun.
